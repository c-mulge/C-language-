Welcome to the C language practice repository!

This repository contains a collection of C language programming exercises and solutions to help you practice your C programming skills. Each exercise is designed to challenge you and test your understanding of key concepts in C programming.

To get started, simply navigate to the "exercises" folder and choose an exercise that interests you. Each exercise comes with a detailed description of the problem to be solved and instructions on how to approach the problem.

Once you have completed an exercise, you can check your solution by navigating to the "solutions" folder and finding the corresponding solution file. The solution files are provided in both C and Python languages, so you can compare your solution to the provided solutions and learn from them.

We encourage you to explore this repository and work through as many exercises as possible to strengthen your C programming skills. Feel free to contribute your own exercises and solutions by creating a pull request. We are always looking to expand the repository and provide more opportunities for C programming practice.

Happy coding!
